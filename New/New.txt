question about NDE algorithm

Dear Dr. Xingbao Gao, 

Hope everything goes well with you. 
I try to implement  the NDE algorithm,
which is presented in your paper "Differential evolution with neighborhood-based adaptive
evolution mechanism for numerical optimization" (Information Sciences 478 (2019) 422–448).
And I have simple but important for me question.

Is the unsorted population or the population, which sorted by fitness value, used to construct the   neighborhood N(i) of the i-th individual?
Are cyclic conditions used?


Sincerely, 
Oleg Olikh,
