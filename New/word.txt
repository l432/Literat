So far, crystalline silicon solar cells are dominant in the photovoltaic field due to their high efficiency, low selling price and process maturity.

Since room temperature (300 K) measurements of I–V and C–V characteristics alone cannot provide detailed information about the mechanisms responsible for the formation of barrier  at the interface of the MS and electrical properties of devices, additional insight is gained by characterising the diodes
over a wide temperature range (40–300 K). 

The analysis of  the current-voltage (I-V)  characteristic of  a solar cell is one of  the most important diagnostic methods that may be used  to characterize the solar cell.  The current-voltage  equation that models the solar cell by  an equivalent electrical circuit contains several parameters related to physical phenomena occurring in  the device.  Changes in the parameter values may  reveal  important information about  the effects of  environmental conditions (e.g. radiation  effects on space solar cells) or manufacturing processes on  the performance of  solar cell. 

initial iron concentration at or below 1013 cm3 has no observable influence on...

Beside well developed silicon PV which covers almost 90% of global market [1] the other technologies such as dye-sensitized [2] or thin ?lm [3] solar cells are available.

Fig. 4 shows the  series resistance  over the explored temperature range. 

The contacts size was chosen to avoid edge effects

Metal-Semiconductor (M-S) contacts are found to be important research activity because the knowledge of barrier formation is still far from the complete despite the fact that they are work horse at many electronic 
applications  like surge protection,  high speed operation, microwave field effect transistors, radio frequency detectors, temperature sensors and solar cells etc.
