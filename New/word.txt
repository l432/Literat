So far, crystalline silicon solar cells are dominant in the photovoltaic field due to their high efficiency, low selling price and process maturity.

Since room temperature (300 K) measurements of I–V and C–V characteristics alone cannot provide detailed information about the mechanisms responsible for the formation of barrier  at the interface of the MS and electrical properties of devices, additional insight is gained by characterising the diodes
over a wide temperature range (40–300 K). 

The analysis of  the current-voltage (I-V)  characteristic of  a solar cell is one of  the most important diagnostic methods that may be used  to characterize the solar cell.  The current-voltage  equation that models the solar cell by  an equivalent electrical circuit contains several parameters related to physical phenomena occurring in  the device.  Changes in the parameter values may  reveal  important information about  the effects of  environmental conditions (e.g. radiation  effects on space solar cells) or manufacturing processes on  the performance of  solar cell.
