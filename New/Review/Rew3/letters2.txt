Reviewer #1 (Comments to the Author): 

The paper is about study of influence of ultrasound on electrical properties of silicon Schottky barrier structure. The topic is interesting to wide range of readers. The authors are bringing into community a methodology of processing of semiconductor materials and devices. The work is systematic. Current-voltage dependence at different temperatures and related device parameters have been studied. Theory is involved to describe and understand the experimental results. Conclusions and abstract reflect main results of the article. References are appropriate. Quality of figures are very good. The work could be a good article for Journal of Applied Physics. I have minor comments: 

1. The reason for selection of power, frequency of ultrasound and duration of processing by ultrasound should be discussed. 

2. Frequency of the ultrasound is 8.4 MHz, which is equivalent to wavelength of about 36 m, which exceeds thickness of 250 micrometer of the silicon processed by the ultrasound. Some discussion about absorbency of the ultrasound by the Si would be interesting.

Reviewer #2 (Comments to the Author): 

1. By means of the equation (7) the flat band barrier height is determined. However, the comparison with theoretical value of barrier height is not reported. It is necessary to give some detail on this topic. 

2. It is demonstrated that there is a distribution of different patches with varies barrier height, but it is not mentioned the theoretical value of barrier height and its position in the Gaussian distribution. The values obtained of double Gaussian distribution include the ideal value? 

3. The double Gaussian distribution show the presence of two different barrier heights: Φb,1 and Φb,2 . Which is the physics explanation of this behavior? Can be attributed at particular defects? It is important to report some details in the text. 

4. In the page 4 is reported an explanation of the reversible Schottky barrier height variation due to ultrasound action. The paper is based on the effect of ultrasound on the interface characteristics; it can be useful to insert a schematic (such as band diagram or something else) which tries to better explain the hypothesis. 

5. The equation (10) is related to the reference number 38, but in this paper is not reported this equation. It is necessary to change the reference or to integrate it with appropriate one.
