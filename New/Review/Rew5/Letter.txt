Dear Dr. Olikh,

I am attaching, in pdf format, a manuscript in your field (a new parameter
extraction technique for diodes and solar cells)
recently submitted to Solid State Electronics.  

I would be extremely grateful if you or a colleague of yours could express your opinion
on its suitability for publication.  

I am sending an electronic review form (Word format), but an e-mail
response with comments would be fine as well.  I very much hope to receive your report
within 3 weeks.

I would like to thank you in anticipation of your help and am looking forward to
hearing from you.
Please confirm that you are able to view the files.

Best regards, с уважением, 
Alex Zaslavsky
