The review comments for the review article are given below,
1. Almost all the data and conclusion presented has no novelty.
2. Many of the refernecnes were not complete, means with no page number, volume, doi etc.,
3. Still many of the recent articles were not referred and the literature review is weak.
4. Conclusion provided must be strong enough to validate the presented articels. but it failed. 


The authors have presented a review of visual inspection and detection techniques for identifying failure modes and potential defects in solar modules. However, every review must provide an analysis based on the literature rather than merely reporting it. At present, this manuscript only reports the literature without offering any original analysis.
There are numerous review papers already available on this topic, and it is unclear how this paper distinguishes itself from them. Below is a list of some existing reviews on the same subject:
