When you update to a new SCAPS version (thus not install a new version), it is not necessary to first uninstall any previously installed version of SCAPS; but a (former) version of SCAPS should have been installed already.

Find your SCAPS folder, that is where your scaps28.exe or ... scaps3308.exe files reside. Copy the six files below for SCAPS3.3.09 and place them in in your SCAPS folder:

These are the programme file 
scaps3309.exe, the user interface resource file 
gui3308.uir, two files for the SCAPS user dll, 
Scapsdll.dll and 
SCAPSdll.lib, the file 
panelzize3309.txt and the file 
scriptdescription3308.txt. This is the most recent sub-version: 19-12-2020.

You might whish to copy also some auxilary files that are distributed with SCAPS3.3.08 but are (partly) missing in former versions: grading files, absorption files, definition files, "all SCAPS" files, set-up files for batch, recorder and curve fitting operations, script files, materials files, the SCAPS userfunction dll... These are to be placed in their appropriate sub-directories. No zip of these auxilary files have been made for more recent versions... the easiest is to re-instal SCAPS for version3.3.09.

Your previous versions present in the SCAPS directory can still be operated.
